The back-end of an improved Wordle built from scratch. Written in Python, using Django.

Rules:

You have to find a randomly chosen 5 letter English word.
Click 'GO' to check guess or 'Pass' to pass current guess.
Click 'Clear' to erase all letters or click a letter to erase it.
Letters that are in their correct places will get a green background.
Letters that are in their incorrect places will get a yellow background.
Letters that are not in the word will get a red background.
On your 6th and last guess the word's definition will be shown to help you.
